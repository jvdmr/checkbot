# checkbot

This is the source code for check, a bot based on mozbot by Mozilla, that has organically grown for the past 10-15 years in the #infogroep channel (see https://infogroep.be)

Throughout the years, it served mostly as a pet project for me and others to experiment with Perl.

The hope remains that eventually, through mysteries of magical code, it will become sentient.

Some say this may already have happened.
